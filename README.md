## Generate Single-page HTML Export

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5757396/79693148-50620700-8269-11ea-9223-b5a384c9421f.png)

Requires [jArchi](https:www.archimatetool.com/blog/2018/07/02/jarchi/)

This script creates a single HTML page which contains views contained into
selected folders. This HTML page makes heavy use of CSS tricks to create
a dynamic web application which doesn't rely on JavaScript.
This non-JS approach is by design to allow the file to be previewed when
stored on Onedrive Pro, MsTeams or SharePoint Document Library.

To use it, simply download the archive from the [latest release](https://github.com/archi-contribs/jarchi-single-page-html-export/releases) and unzip it in your `scripts` folder. Then select one or more folders containing views and run the script through the context menu.

Mardown rendering of documentations is `on` by default. You can set it `off` in the "Preferences" dialog (cog icon on top right).
